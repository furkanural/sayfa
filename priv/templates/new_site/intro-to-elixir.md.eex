## Abstract

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language built on the Erlang VM. This talk covers the basics of Elixir and why it's a great choice for building reliable, concurrent applications.

## Outline

1. **What is Elixir?** — History, design goals, and the BEAM VM
2. **Pattern Matching** — The foundation of Elixir code
3. **Immutability & Pipes** — Data transformation patterns
4. **Concurrency** — Processes, message passing, and OTP
5. **Real-World Use Cases** — Web apps, embedded systems, and more

## Key Takeaways

- Elixir combines the productivity of Ruby with the reliability of Erlang
- Pattern matching replaces most conditional logic
- The pipe operator makes data transformations readable
- OTP provides battle-tested patterns for building fault-tolerant systems
