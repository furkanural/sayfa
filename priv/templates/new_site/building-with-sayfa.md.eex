## Why Sayfa?

Sayfa is a static site generator built in Elixir. It's designed to be simple, fast, and extensible. This post walks through the key features you can use to build your site.

## Content Types

Sayfa supports multiple content types out of the box:

- **Posts** — Blog posts with dates, tags, and categories
- **Notes** — Short-form content for quick thoughts
- **Projects** — Showcase your work with project pages
- **Talks** — Share your presentations and speaking engagements
- **Pages** — Static pages like "About" or "Contact"

Each content type has its own directory under `content/` and its own URL pattern.

## Front Matter

Every content file starts with YAML front matter. Here's what's available:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
date: 2024-01-15
updated: 2024-01-20
description: "A short description for SEO"
categories: [guides]
tags: [elixir, web]
featured: true
draft: false
layout: post
---
```

## The Content Pipeline

Sayfa processes your content through a pipeline:

1. **Load** — Read Markdown files from disk
2. **Parse** — Extract front matter and Markdown body
3. **Transform** — Generate slugs, render Markdown to HTML
4. **Render** — Apply EEx templates with layout composition
5. **Write** — Output the final HTML files

### Writing Elixir Code

Sayfa uses MDEx for Markdown rendering, which includes syntax highlighting. Here's an example:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Greeter do
  @moduledoc "A simple greeter module."

  def hello(name) do
    name
    |> String.trim()
    |> then(&"Hello, #{&1}!")
  end
end
```

### Using Blocks

Blocks are reusable components you can use in your templates:

```elixir
# In your EEx templates:
<%%= @block.(:hero, title: "Welcome") %>
<%%= @block.(:recent_posts, limit: 5) %>
<%%= @block.(:tag_cloud) %>
```

## Images

Sayfa supports images through the `static/` directory. Any file in `static/` is copied to your site's root during build.

**Featured image** — Add `image:` to your front matter to display a cover image above the post and set the OpenGraph image for social sharing:

```yaml
---
image: /images/cover.jpg
---
```

**Inline images** — Use standard Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/screenshot.png)
```

Place your image files in `static/images/` and reference them with `/images/` paths.

## What's Next?

- Browse the example content in `content/` to see each content type
- Run `mix sayfa.serve` to preview your site locally
- Run `mix sayfa.build` when you're ready to publish
